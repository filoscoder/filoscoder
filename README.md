# About me 👋
I was born in South Korea, raised in Argentina, and worked in many countries like Argentina, United States, Mexico, Spain, and South Korea as well. I worked in Accounting and Finance fields in the past, this experience gives me a new perspective looking at the details and forecasting limited resources, this also allows great improvements in logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

I'm skilled in Javascript environment started on the client-side but always supporting everybody's "back"(end). I'm always open to develop on both, client and the server-side, but I feel more relaxed working as a Backend.

Interested in handling cross-platform cool ideas & developing real-world problem solutions. I'm always aware of the existence of a variated pool of skills that makes me humble & listen-first-minded. I also have strong logical communication skills and a problem-solving attitude.

I speak Spanish, Korean and enough English to be a valuable contributor :)
